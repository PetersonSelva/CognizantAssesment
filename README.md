# CognizantAssesment

- The labels and textfield of the login page are constrained using the add new constraint feature, hence its not hard coded. Moreover, I have put the fields and button into a stack view for easier configuration for constraints for different displays.

- The background colour and button colour are also not hard coded. I have used the facilities within the view to make these changes.

- The Login button is set to move to the next screen upon being tapped, I have done this by creating an identifier for TableView.
